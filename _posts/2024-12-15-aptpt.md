Benjamin (@Mensh123) today sent me his draft of a _Serial Advent Wreath Protocol_, describing what is essentialy a binary Advent Wreath, but in way to complicated terms. So I took the challenge, but instead of writing a better binary counter, I directly opposed him, standardizing both Advent Wreathes and Calendars in what I call _The Advent Progression Tally Protocol_, or APT.Pt. That is a backronym, stemming from what appears to be the chorus of Bruno Mars's new viral hit, _APT._ (which is pronounced with a Korean accent, apparently standing for "Apartment")

You can get APT.Pt/1.0 on [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/libewa/b9439cef39bd738dbefd6f454a0d7c29/ac2e140545c08c48d9efacbaa4f8a8b82958875b). The Gist UI does not show tags yet, but the correct commit is tagged `1.0`.

As a side note/view back stage, this post was written on an iPad using Textastic and Working Copy, the latter of which is also included in the Student developer pack. Expect a blog post about my keyboard layout Soonâ„¢.
